# Raycasting-Engine
A simple Raycasting Engine in pure Java, without any 3rd party libraries. "[...] Raycasting was used to efficiently render a 3D world from a 2D playing field using a simple one-dimensional scan over the horizontal width of the screen." (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_casting)

# Further Development
I do not plan on continuing this project.
